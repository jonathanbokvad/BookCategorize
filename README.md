# BookCategorize
Search, categorize and rate your favorite books in this ASP.NET application. 
Search was made possible by requesting information from Google book API.

## How-to:
- Download or clone the repository.
- A ```localDb``` must be installed.
- The database is created by Entity Framework Core and migrations, ```initialDb```, which already exists in the project.
- Open Visual Studio, then open Package Manager Console (PMC). Now write and run the code ```Update-Database``` in PMC.
- You can now run the program!
